Create a new GitHub issue for a feature idea through interactive discussion.

1. Ask me to describe the feature I want to add
2. Discuss the feature with me:
   - Clarify the problem it solves
   - Define success criteria
   - Identify potential implementation challenges
   - Determine scope and constraints
   - Check for similar existing features

3. Create a well-structured issue with:
   - Clear problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical considerations
   - Estimated complexity
   - Potential risks/blockers
   - Related issues or dependencies

4. Generate GitHub CLI command:
   gh issue create --title "[Feature] [title]" --body "[generated content]" --label "enhancement"

5. Ask if I want to:
   - Modify the issue before creating
   - Add additional labels
   - Assign to someone
   - Add to a project/milestone
