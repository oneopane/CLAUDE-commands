Once enabled, anyone in your workspace can view customer pages, create and update customers, and add customer requests to issues and projects in Linear or from a supported integration.\\n\\nWhen an issue is created from integrations with Intercom, Zendesk, Front, Asks, or Email, it will automatically add a request pointing back to the source. Requests can also be added manually and are viewable in their associated issue and the customer's page.\\n\\nFrom settings, add further customizations. Choose a team to receive new issues created from a request by default (we recommend selecting a team exclusively used to track feedback). You can also customize revenue units and tiers for different plans or products you offer. Revenue, Tier and Size fields will be automatically populated if you use the Intercom integration, or can be filled when creating customers manually.\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nA Customer in Linear represents an organization using your product. Customers have a unique domain, name, logo, and attributes which can be viewed on their page.\\n\\nCustomer pages\\n\\nCustomer pages show all issues and projects with a request associated with that customer. You can group and order this list of issues to see what issues have been marked as important or what issues are in progress. Click on individual issues to open and view their request on that issue in full detail.\\n\\nFor customers created through Intercom or manually, you'll also see attributes like the customer's revenue, status, tier, and size on the customer page. Individual customer pages can be favorited so that they're easy to access from the sidebar. \\n\\nOpen Customer pages\\n\\nUse O then Q, then search for the customer's name\\n\\nOpen the full customer list with G then Q, then search to narrow down results\\n\\nSearch for the customer in the Cmd/Ctrl + K menu\\n\\nCreate Customers\\n\\nCustomer requests\\n\\nCustomer requests link user feedback to specific issues in Linear.\\n\\nAdd requests to issues or projects\\n\\nA customer request is created automatically whenever you create or link to an issue or project from a supported integration. The request will appear both on the issue/project itself as well as on the associated customer's page.\\n\\nIntegrations\\n\\nThe following integrations can create issues with customer requests:\\n\\nMark as important\\n\\nRequests can be flagged as important to specific customers. For instance, an issue or project may have requests from five different customers but be marked as important by only one of those customers. This binary indicator, shown as a triangle, lets customer-facing teams separate requests that represent a critical need from those expressing a nice-to-have feature.\\n\\nBuild customer views\\n\\nAll customer data brought into Linear can be used to create custom views for both issues and projects to surface the impact of your work on your customers. For example, create a view of issues with requests from Enterprise customers (\\\"Tier\\\" property from Intercom), where each issue has at least 20 requests. Ordering this view by customer count surfaces the most highly requested issues to the top. Triangle icons indicating requests marked important surface urgent needs.  Consider consulting this view when planning upcoming cycles to ensure what you ship aligns with the needs of the users. \\n\\nNotifications \\n\\nYou'll receive Inbox notifications automatically when new requests are added to issues you subscribe to so you're always in the loop. Optionally, configure additional notification styles for new requests here.\\n\\nSubscribing to custom views is the best option for more targeted alerts. For example, you might wish to stay aware of issues commonly raised by customers who churn. To track that, create a custom view defined by Customer status includes Churned, and ordering the issues by customer revenue. Click the bell icon to be alerted when a new issue is added to the view, or configure notifications to a Slack channel for greater visibility. \\nYou can also open a specific customer page (O then Q) and under the bell icon subscribe to get notified when a request is added, marked important, completed or cancelled.\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\n\"},{\"id\":\"d18be606-1c69-4a81-a598-a2cf5b4f7b33\",\"title\":\"Security\",\"url\":\"https://linear.app/docs/security\",\"snippet\":\"Learn more about our data security practices and compliance measures.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nLinear is built with best-in-class security practices to keep your work safe and secure at every layer.

The Linear plugin for Figma allows you to create and link issues directly from Figma. A separate integration enables you to embed designs into Linear descriptions, comments and documents. \\n\\nConfigure\\n\\nEmbed Figma previews in Linear\\n\\nConnect to Figma under Settings > Features > Integrations > Figma. We recommend that you do this in a browser and not the desktop client. Once connected, the integration will work across your full workspace.\\n\\nLinear plugin for Figma\\n\\nTo create or link issues from Figma, select a frame, section or link and run the Linear plugin from Resources > Plugins > Linear or run directly from the Figma community here.\\n\\nEmbed Figma Previews\\n\\nPreview designs\\n\\nSimply copy a link to specific frames or files and paste it into a Linear issue description or comment. We automatically convert the link into a design preview. Even if the file changes, the snapshot in Linear remains as it appeared when the comment or description was created. \\n\\nOpen files\\n\\nClick to preview the embedded file without having to leave Linear. We currently support interactive in-app preview of publicly shared Figma files only. We're considering building support for private files in the future. We built this as a custom integration using Figma's API with their OAuth2 authentication instead of using their standard embed to create a faster experience.\\n\\nRefresh files\\n\\nBy default, we do not refresh the Figma preview so that you maintain the context of related comments and issue descriptions. To update the preview, go into Edit mode in the issue or comment, then hover over the Figma file. You'll see a Refresh button appear, which you can click to pull the latest version. This action cannot be undone.\\n\\nLinear Plugin for Figma\\n\\nRun the plugin to see all Linear issues linked to your designs. From the plugin, select issues or the linked elements below the issue description to be taken to the inked frame, section, or page.\\n\\nCreate issues\\n\\nWhen using the Linear plugin from within Figma, select the + button to create issues that link pages, frames, and sections of your Figma design. You'll be able to create issues in any teams that you've joined. \\n\\nLink issues\\n\\nLink designs to existing issues by searching for the ID, title, or description. From the Linear side, you can link designs to issues by attaching Figma links for the page, section, or frame using Ctrl L. You can link multiple issues to the same design and multiple frames, sections, or pages to a single Linear issue. \\n\\nUpdate issues\\n\\nUpdate properties such as team, status, assignee, and project directly from Figma. You'll be able to update these at any point during your design process. Any changes made in Linear are immediately synced to the Figma plugin.\\n\\nFilter and sort\\n\\nFilter your issues that appear in the plugin window to hide completed or cancelled issues, show only assigned or created by you, and to sort by status, priority, nam, or created date. By default, the plugin will hide canceled issues.\\n\\nFigma Plugin \\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Service By authenticating the plugin, you agree to Linear's Terms of Service. Plugin authentication grants you access to Linear's features and functionality.\\n\\nFigma File Key Transmission When the plugin is opened within Figma, Linear will receive the file key for the current Figma file. When connecting a frame in Figma to a Linear issue, Linear will receive and securely store the file key associated with the respective Figma file. This storage of file keys allows Linear to establish the necessary connection and enable bi-directional linking between Figma and Linear.\\n\\nFigma File Key Access Any user with access to a Linear issue will also have access to the associated file key for any linked Figma frames.\\n\\nData Removal Users have the authority to remove Figma data stored by Linear at any time. This can be achieved by either disconnecting the frame from the Linear issue or deleting the associated team or workspace. To permanently delete your data from Linear’s storage contact security@linear.app\\n\\nData Processing All data, including Figma file keys, is processed by Linear in accordance with Linear’s Data Processing Agreement (DPA).

Once enabled, anyone in your Slack workspace can create an Ask to send their request to the relevant Linear team — even if they don’t have a Linear account.\\n\\nWatch this video overview of how Asks works:\\n\\nHere are some examples of how different teams can use Asks:\\n\\nLinear Asks and Advanced Linear Asks\\n\\nAsks features are available in both Business and Enterprise plans, with additional features available to Enterprise workspaces as follows: \\n\\nConfigure Asks\\n\\nBefore setting up Asks, consider how you want members of your Slack workspace to create Asks and which Linear teams will review and manage those Asks. You can make changes to the Asks configuration easily, but it will require customization to match your preferred workflows. \\n\\nYou should also install our separate Slack integration first if you plan to use both integrations. That integration needs to be installed before Linear Asks in order to correctly handle Linear issue previews. \\n\\nVideo guide\\n\\nStep-by-step guide\\n\\nStep 1: Install Asks\\n\\nA Linear admin must take this step in Settings > Asks. Once they do, members (not guests) can update the Asks configuration and add new channels or templates.\\n\\nAsks is available on Business and Enterprise plans. Read more about our plans here. \\n\\nAsks supports connecting your Linear workspace to only one Slack workspace.\\n\\nLinear Asks must be installed separately from the Slack integration.\\n\\nStep 2: Connect channels and invite @Linear Asks\\n\\nClick Add channel to select a Slack channel where Asks can be created. Repeat this process for each channel that will be used to create Asks. \\n\\nTo allow Asks to be created in any public channel in your Slack workspace, use the All public channels section. Please note that you must still add Asks to each channel with /invite @Linear Asks in Slack before Asks can be created.\\n\\nIn private channels (Enterprise), the Asks app must be invited to the Slack channel after configuration with /invite @Linear Asks\\n\\nAsks can be created from 1-1 DMs, but DMs do not need to be added as channels here. Asks templates added to Private Asks in Settings > Asks are available when creating Asks in DMs.\\n\\nStep 3: Add teams and templates to channels\\n\\nFirst add teams that you’ll want issues routed to, then select templates available under each team.\\n\\nIf you wish to allow users to submit Asks without selecting a template, keep \\\"Create Asks without a template\\\" enabled. \\n\\nYou can add multiple teams and templates to each channel. Learn how to customize templates to build out structured forms below. \\n\\nWorkspace level templates are not available for use with Asks.\\n\\nIf you're using auto-creation options, select a default template by hovering over the template you wish to use, and clicking \\\"Set as default\\\". This templates properties will apply to auto-created Asks in the set context. The description of the template will not be used and will be replaced by the user's message. If you'd just like to select a default team, consider selecting a default of \\\"Create Asks without a template.\\\"\\n\\nStep 4: Configure Private Asks\\n\\nThere are some Asks that you’ll want to keep private between the requester and the team managing the issue. Add these sensitive requests under the Private Asks section in Asks settings.\\n\\nUsers can create these Asks in the Asks app home (Apps > Linear Asks in Slack's sidebar)\\n\\nAdd teams and templates to Private Asks in Settings > Asks as you would to another Asks Slack channel\\n\\nEnsure that the Linear teams you connect to Private Asks are also private. This guarantees that only members of the desired Linear team will see content shared on that issue.\\n\\nAsks created in DMs are also considered Private Asks, as a DM is a private context. When an Ask is created through a DM, the synced thread will be available in relevant user's DM with Linear Asks. Only templates added to Private Asks are available in DMs\\n\\nStep 5: Set permissions for managing Asks\\n\\nLinear admins can determine whether Asks channels, teams and templates can be managed by all users, or admins only.\\n\\nAuto-creating Asks\\n\\nConfigure automations in settings to allow Asks to be created automatically. Asks auto-creation is not supported in DMs.\\n\\nCustomize Templates\\n\\nWhen creating Asks from a template, the newly created issue will use the properties assigned to the template by default. Create or edit templates under Template settings for the relevant team. Workspace-level templates cannot be associated with Linear Asks. \\n\\nFormatting tools\\n\\nThere are a variety of formatting tools at the template level you can use to customize the behavior of a particular template.\\n\\nHere's what some of these formatting tools look like in context:\\n\\nCreating additional fields\\n\\nIn addition to the template defaults, you can configure additional user-fillable property fields on templates for specific use in Asks.\\n\\nThese fields include priority, due date, file upload, and selecting a sub-label from a label group. You can also configure to show an input field for your Customers in Linear, which will appear when the requester also is a member or admin in your workspace. These fields can be marked as required; please note that if you set required fields on a default template for a channel, auto-creation options will not be available.\\n\\nIn this example below, the Platform label group and the Customer field have been added to the Asks template.\\n\\nSubmit Asks in Slack\\n\\nFrom any connected channel or DM in Slack, use the following actions to create an Ask:\\n\\nOnce created, Asks will create a threaded reply with a link to the Ask and connected Linear issue. The Slack thread and Linear issue share a synced comment thread, so comments and files can be shared across both applications.\\n\\nManage your Asks from Slack\\n\\nView Asks\\n\\nSee a list of all active and closed Asks in Asks app home. Select Open thread to go the the Ask in the channel it was created in. You can also view Asks and their threads (including private Asks) in the Messages tab.\\n\\nMark as urgent\\n\\nIf your Ask is urgent, you can choose to override its default priority by selecting the Mark as urgent option in your Ask's unfurl menu. This will also apply a siren emoji to your Ask for better visibility in Slack.\\n\\nSee status and assignee\\n\\nAsks app home will show the real-time status and assignee of your Ask. You'll also be notified in the original thread when your issue leaves Triage (all Asks start in Triage), and when it's completed, canceled, or reopened. In a shared channel using Asks, users from the other organization will not see Asks app home.\\n\\nReply and share files\\n\\nReply to the Slack thread to ask questions, follow up on the Ask, or even send files, screenshots, and video to the assignee working on your Ask. All replies are sent to the Linear issue on a synced comment thread.\\n\\nClose Asks\\n\\nYou’ll get a notification on the thread whenever a comment is posted to the Ask and when the Ask is completed, canceled, or re-opened. When completed, the Ask message will also have a ✅ on the original Ask.\\n\\nYou can close your own Asks from in Slack from Apps > Asks > Home if needed by changing its status. \\n\\nTriage Asks in Linear\\n\\nTriage is a Linear team's inbox, and the best place for processing new issues. \\n\\nWhen Asks are submitted to your team, they'll always arrive in your team's Triage. From there, they can be reviewed, prioritized, and assigned.\\n\\nDuplicate detection\\n\\nIssues in Triage are automatically evaluated for their similarity to existing issues in your workspace. In cases where an issue with a similar title and description already exists in your workspace, you'll be presented with an option to mark the Ask as a duplicate of, or related to the existing issue. \\n\\nTriage automations\\n\\nWe recommend configuring Triage responsibility to automate who gets notified or assigned issues as they come in. You can also link to a PagerDuty schedule.\\n\\nTriage-specific SLAs\\n\\nSet up SLAs to automatically apply deadlines to Asks in SLA settings. You can specify different deadlines for how long an issue can stay in Triage versus how long it takes to complete the issue. Consider creating two different SLAs — one filtered to status: Triage (so it only applies when the issue is in Triage) and one filtered to external source: Asks but without a status filter.\\n\\nWorking on Asks in Linear\\n\\nWork on Asks issues in Linear as you would a regular issue. \\n\\nWhoever submitted the Ask can see the issue status, assignee, and reply in the synced comment thread. They will be notified on the thread automatically when the Ask is completed, canceled, or re-opened.\\n\\nUsers with a Linear account will be able to make updates to Asks from Slack using the Quick Actions menu, including changing the status and assigning it to themselves.\\n\\nSend updates to Slack\\n\\nAll Asks issues in Linear have a comment thread synced with Slack. Any replies to this shared comment thread will cross-post to the Asks Slack thread and notify the creator of the Ask (and vice versa). Find it at the top of the issue's activity feed. \\n\\nThreads in Slack and Linear will update as replies are sent in either location. \\n\\nYou can send across files such as images, videos, and PDFs.\\n\\nThe Asks thread will be updated when the Ask leaves triage, is completed, canceled, or re-opened. You'll see a ✅ on the initial Ask message when it's completed or ✖️ when it's canceled. If you prefer not to notify a thread for cancelations, you can opt-out of that behavior per channel in Asks settings.\\n\\nAnalytics & Reporting\\n\\nInsights shows you realtime analytics of your Linear data so you can spot trends and remove blockers.\\n\\nLook at Insights for specific teams or create a workspace-wide view to look at your Asks data across your workspace. Consider using the following parameters to filter your views, as well as to measure, slice, and segment your data.\\n\\nExternal source: Apply this filter on a view and then select Asks to see only issues filed through Asks.  \\n\\nTeams: Slice by team to better understand the differences between how different Linear teams process Asks.\\n\\nTemplates: Slice by template to see how your different Asks templates are used across a team or workspace.\\n\\nSLAs and Lead time: Explore how quickly Asks are resolved and whether your team is meeting SLAs.\\n\\nTriage time: See how quickly Asks are reviewed and assigned to a team member.\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\n\"},{\"id\":\"5d0a0985-9774-419f-8aa2-4cc07b4926ab\",\"title\":\"Private teams\",\"url\":\"https://linear.app/docs/private-teams\",\"snippet\":\"Create private teams for issues that should only be accessed by certain workspace members.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nThis feature is available on Linear's Business and Enterprise plans.

Once enabled, anyone in your workspace can view customer pages, create and update customers, and add customer requests to issues and projects in Linear or from a supported integration.\\n\\nWhen an issue is created from integrations with Intercom, Zendesk, Front, Asks, or Email, it will automatically add a request pointing back to the source. Requests can also be added manually and are viewable in their associated issue and the customer's page.\\n\\nFrom settings, add further customizations. Choose a team to receive new issues created from a request by default (we recommend selecting a team exclusively used to track feedback). You can also customize revenue units and tiers for different plans or products you offer. Revenue, Tier and Size fields will be automatically populated if you use the Intercom integration, or can be filled when creating customers manually.\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nA Customer in Linear represents an organization using your product. Customers have a unique domain, name, logo, and attributes which can be viewed on their page.\\n\\nCustomer pages\\n\\nCustomer pages show all issues and projects with a request associated with that customer. You can group and order this list of issues to see what issues have been marked as important or what issues are in progress. Click on individual issues to open and view their request on that issue in full detail.\\n\\nFor customers created through Intercom or manually, you'll also see attributes like the customer's revenue, status, tier, and size on the customer page. Individual customer pages can be favorited so that they're easy to access from the sidebar. \\n\\nOpen Customer pages\\n\\nUse O then Q, then search for the customer's name\\n\\nOpen the full customer list with G then Q, then search to narrow down results\\n\\nSearch for the customer in the Cmd/Ctrl + K menu\\n\\nCreate Customers\\n\\nCustomer requests\\n\\nCustomer requests link user feedback to specific issues in Linear.\\n\\nAdd requests to issues or projects\\n\\nA customer request is created automatically whenever you create or link to an issue or project from a supported integration. The request will appear both on the issue/project itself as well as on the associated customer's page.\\n\\nIntegrations\\n\\nThe following integrations can create issues with customer requests:\\n\\nMark as important\\n\\nRequests can be flagged as important to specific customers. For instance, an issue or project may have requests from five different customers but be marked as important by only one of those customers. This binary indicator, shown as a triangle, lets customer-facing teams separate requests that represent a critical need from those expressing a nice-to-have feature.\\n\\nBuild customer views\\n\\nAll customer data brought into Linear can be used to create custom views for both issues and projects to surface the impact of your work on your customers. For example, create a view of issues with requests from Enterprise customers (\\\"Tier\\\" property from Intercom), where each issue has at least 20 requests. Ordering this view by customer count surfaces the most highly requested issues to the top. Triangle icons indicating requests marked important surface urgent needs.  Consider consulting this view when planning upcoming cycles to ensure what you ship aligns with the needs of the users. \\n\\nNotifications \\n\\nYou'll receive Inbox notifications automatically when new requests are added to issues you subscribe to so you're always in the loop. Optionally, configure additional notification styles for new requests here.\\n\\nSubscribing to custom views is the best option for more targeted alerts. For example, you might wish to stay aware of issues commonly raised by customers who churn. To track that, create a custom view defined by Customer status includes Churned, and ordering the issues by customer revenue. Click the bell icon to be alerted when a new issue is added to the view, or configure notifications to a Slack channel for greater visibility. \\nYou can also open a specific customer page (O then Q) and under the bell icon subscribe to get notified when a request is added, marked important, completed or cancelled.\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\n\"},{\"id\":\"d18be606-1c69-4a81-a598-a2cf5b4f7b33\",\"title\":\"Security\",\"url\":\"https://linear.app/docs/security\",\"snippet\":\"Learn more about our data security practices and compliance measures.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nLinear is built with best-in-class security practices to keep your work safe and secure at every layer.

The Linear plugin for Figma allows you to create and link issues directly from Figma. A separate integration enables you to embed designs into Linear descriptions, comments and documents. \\n\\nConfigure\\n\\nEmbed Figma previews in Linear\\n\\nConnect to Figma under Settings > Features > Integrations > Figma. We recommend that you do this in a browser and not the desktop client. Once connected, the integration will work across your full workspace.\\n\\nLinear plugin for Figma\\n\\nTo create or link issues from Figma, select a frame, section or link and run the Linear plugin from Resources > Plugins > Linear or run directly from the Figma community here.\\n\\nEmbed Figma Previews\\n\\nPreview designs\\n\\nSimply copy a link to specific frames or files and paste it into a Linear issue description or comment. We automatically convert the link into a design preview. Even if the file changes, the snapshot in Linear remains as it appeared when the comment or description was created. \\n\\nOpen files\\n\\nClick to preview the embedded file without having to leave Linear. We currently support interactive in-app preview of publicly shared Figma files only. We're considering building support for private files in the future. We built this as a custom integration using Figma's API with their OAuth2 authentication instead of using their standard embed to create a faster experience.\\n\\nRefresh files\\n\\nBy default, we do not refresh the Figma preview so that you maintain the context of related comments and issue descriptions. To update the preview, go into Edit mode in the issue or comment, then hover over the Figma file. You'll see a Refresh button appear, which you can click to pull the latest version. This action cannot be undone.\\n\\nLinear Plugin for Figma\\n\\nRun the plugin to see all Linear issues linked to your designs. From the plugin, select issues or the linked elements below the issue description to be taken to the inked frame, section, or page.\\n\\nCreate issues\\n\\nWhen using the Linear plugin from within Figma, select the + button to create issues that link pages, frames, and sections of your Figma design. You'll be able to create issues in any teams that you've joined. \\n\\nLink issues\\n\\nLink designs to existing issues by searching for the ID, title, or description. From the Linear side, you can link designs to issues by attaching Figma links for the page, section, or frame using Ctrl L. You can link multiple issues to the same design and multiple frames, sections, or pages to a single Linear issue. \\n\\nUpdate issues\\n\\nUpdate properties such as team, status, assignee, and project directly from Figma. You'll be able to update these at any point during your design process. Any changes made in Linear are immediately synced to the Figma plugin.\\n\\nFilter and sort\\n\\nFilter your issues that appear in the plugin window to hide completed or cancelled issues, show only assigned or created by you, and to sort by status, priority, nam, or created date. By default, the plugin will hide canceled issues.\\n\\nFigma Plugin \\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Service By authenticating the plugin, you agree to Linear's Terms of Service. Plugin authentication grants you access to Linear's features and functionality.\\n\\nFigma File Key Transmission When the plugin is opened within Figma, Linear will receive the file key for the current Figma file. When connecting a frame in Figma to a Linear issue, Linear will receive and securely store the file key associated with the respective Figma file. This storage of file keys allows Linear to establish the necessary connection and enable bi-directional linking between Figma and Linear.\\n\\nFigma File Key Access Any user with access to a Linear issue will also have access to the associated file key for any linked Figma frames.\\n\\nData Removal Users have the authority to remove Figma data stored by Linear at any time. This can be achieved by either disconnecting the frame from the Linear issue or deleting the associated team or workspace. To permanently delete your data from Linear’s storage contact security@linear.app\\n\\nData Processing All data, including Figma file keys, is processed by Linear in accordance with Linear’s Data Processing Agreement (DPA).

Once enabled, anyone in your Slack workspace can create an Ask to send their request to the relevant Linear team — even if they don’t have a Linear account.\\n\\nWatch this video overview of how Asks works:\\n\\nHere are some examples of how different teams can use Asks:\\n\\nLinear Asks and Advanced Linear Asks\\n\\nAsks features are available in both Business and Enterprise plans, with additional features available to Enterprise workspaces as follows: \\n\\nConfigure Asks\\n\\nBefore setting up Asks, consider how you want members of your Slack workspace to create Asks and which Linear teams will review and manage those Asks. You can make changes to the Asks configuration easily, but it will require customization to match your preferred workflows. \\n\\nYou should also install our separate Slack integration first if you plan to use both integrations. That integration needs to be installed before Linear Asks in order to correctly handle Linear issue previews. \\n\\nVideo guide\\n\\nStep-by-step guide\\n\\nStep 1: Install Asks\\n\\nA Linear admin must take this step in Settings > Asks. Once they do, members (not guests) can update the Asks configuration and add new channels or templates.\\n\\nAsks is available on Business and Enterprise plans. Read more about our plans here. \\n\\nAsks supports connecting your Linear workspace to only one Slack workspace.\\n\\nLinear Asks must be installed separately from the Slack integration.\\n\\nStep 2: Connect channels and invite @Linear Asks\\n\\nClick Add channel to select a Slack channel where Asks can be created. Repeat this process for each channel that will be used to create Asks. \\n\\nTo allow Asks to be created in any public channel in your Slack workspace, use the All public channels section. Please note that you must still add Asks to each channel with /invite @Linear Asks in Slack before Asks can be created.\\n\\nIn private channels (Enterprise), the Asks app must be invited to the Slack channel after configuration with /invite @Linear Asks\\n\\nAsks can be created from 1-1 DMs, but DMs do not need to be added as channels here. Asks templates added to Private Asks in Settings > Asks are available when creating Asks in DMs.\\n\\nStep 3: Add teams and templates to channels\\n\\nFirst add teams that you’ll want issues routed to, then select templates available under each team.\\n\\nIf you wish to allow users to submit Asks without selecting a template, keep \\\"Create Asks without a template\\\" enabled. \\n\\nYou can add multiple teams and templates to each channel. Learn how to customize templates to build out structured forms below. \\n\\nWorkspace level templates are not available for use with Asks.\\n\\nIf you're using auto-creation options, select a default template by hovering over the template you wish to use, and clicking \\\"Set as default\\\". This templates properties will apply to auto-created Asks in the set context. The description of the template will not be used and will be replaced by the user's message. If you'd just like to select a default team, consider selecting a default of \\\"Create Asks without a template.\\\"\\n\\nStep 4: Configure Private Asks\\n\\nThere are some Asks that you’ll want to keep private between the requester and the team managing the issue. Add these sensitive requests under the Private Asks section in Asks settings.\\n\\nUsers can create these Asks in the Asks app home (Apps > Linear Asks in Slack's sidebar)\\n\\nAdd teams and templates to Private Asks in Settings > Asks as you would to another Asks Slack channel\\n\\nEnsure that the Linear teams you connect to Private Asks are also private. This guarantees that only members of the desired Linear team will see content shared on that issue.\\n\\nAsks created in DMs are also considered Private Asks, as a DM is a private context. When an Ask is created through a DM, the synced thread will be available in relevant user's DM with Linear Asks. Only templates added to Private Asks are available in DMs\\n\\nStep 5: Set permissions for managing Asks\\n\\nLinear admins can determine whether Asks channels, teams and templates can be managed by all users, or admins only.\\n\\nAuto-creating Asks\\n\\nConfigure automations in settings to allow Asks to be created automatically. Asks auto-creation is not supported in DMs.\\n\\nCustomize Templates\\n\\nWhen creating Asks from a template, the newly created issue will use the properties assigned to the template by default. Create or edit templates under Template settings for the relevant team. Workspace-level templates cannot be associated with Linear Asks. \\n\\nFormatting tools\\n\\nThere are a variety of formatting tools at the template level you can use to customize the behavior of a particular template.\\n\\nHere's what some of these formatting tools look like in context:\\n\\nCreating additional fields\\n\\nIn addition to the template defaults, you can configure additional user-fillable property fields on templates for specific use in Asks.\\n\\nThese fields include priority, due date, file upload, and selecting a sub-label from a label group. You can also configure to show an input field for your Customers in Linear, which will appear when the requester also is a member or admin in your workspace. These fields can be marked as required; please note that if you set required fields on a default template for a channel, auto-creation options will not be available.\\n\\nIn this example below, the Platform label group and the Customer field have been added to the Asks template.\\n\\nSubmit Asks in Slack\\n\\nFrom any connected channel or DM in Slack, use the following actions to create an Ask:\\n\\nOnce created, Asks will create a threaded reply with a link to the Ask and connected Linear issue. The Slack thread and Linear issue share a synced comment thread, so comments and files can be shared across both applications.\\n\\nManage your Asks from Slack\\n\\nView Asks\\n\\nSee a list of all active and closed Asks in Asks app home. Select Open thread to go the the Ask in the channel it was created in. You can also view Asks and their threads (including private Asks) in the Messages tab.\\n\\nMark as urgent\\n\\nIf your Ask is urgent, you can choose to override its default priority by selecting the Mark as urgent option in your Ask's unfurl menu. This will also apply a siren emoji to your Ask for better visibility in Slack.\\n\\nSee status and assignee\\n\\nAsks app home will show the real-time status and assignee of your Ask. You'll also be notified in the original thread when your issue leaves Triage (all Asks start in Triage), and when it's completed, canceled, or reopened. In a shared channel using Asks, users from the other organization will not see Asks app home.\\n\\nReply and share files\\n\\nReply to the Slack thread to ask questions, follow up on the Ask, or even send files, screenshots, and video to the assignee working on your Ask. All replies are sent to the Linear issue on a synced comment thread.\\n\\nClose Asks\\n\\nYou’ll get a notification on the thread whenever a comment is posted to the Ask and when the Ask is completed, canceled, or re-opened. When completed, the Ask message will also have a ✅ on the original Ask.\\n\\nYou can close your own Asks from in Slack from Apps > Asks > Home if needed by changing its status. \\n\\nTriage Asks in Linear\\n\\nTriage is a Linear team's inbox, and the best place for processing new issues. \\n\\nWhen Asks are submitted to your team, they'll always arrive in your team's Triage. From there, they can be reviewed, prioritized, and assigned.\\n\\nDuplicate detection\\n\\nIssues in Triage are automatically evaluated for their similarity to existing issues in your workspace. In cases where an issue with a similar title and description already exists in your workspace, you'll be presented with an option to mark the Ask as a duplicate of, or related to the existing issue. \\n\\nTriage automations\\n\\nWe recommend configuring Triage responsibility to automate who gets notified or assigned issues as they come in. You can also link to a PagerDuty schedule.\\n\\nTriage-specific SLAs\\n\\nSet up SLAs to automatically apply deadlines to Asks in SLA settings. You can specify different deadlines for how long an issue can stay in Triage versus how long it takes to complete the issue. Consider creating two different SLAs — one filtered to status: Triage (so it only applies when the issue is in Triage) and one filtered to external source: Asks but without a status filter.\\n\\nWorking on Asks in Linear\\n\\nWork on Asks issues in Linear as you would a regular issue. \\n\\nWhoever submitted the Ask can see the issue status, assignee, and reply in the synced comment thread. They will be notified on the thread automatically when the Ask is completed, canceled, or re-opened.\\n\\nUsers with a Linear account will be able to make updates to Asks from Slack using the Quick Actions menu, including changing the status and assigning it to themselves.\\n\\nSend updates to Slack\\n\\nAll Asks issues in Linear have a comment thread synced with Slack. Any replies to this shared comment thread will cross-post to the Asks Slack thread and notify the creator of the Ask (and vice versa). Find it at the top of the issue's activity feed. \\n\\nThreads in Slack and Linear will update as replies are sent in either location. \\n\\nYou can send across files such as images, videos, and PDFs.\\n\\nThe Asks thread will be updated when the Ask leaves triage, is completed, canceled, or re-opened. You'll see a ✅ on the initial Ask message when it's completed or ✖️ when it's canceled. If you prefer not to notify a thread for cancelations, you can opt-out of that behavior per channel in Asks settings.\\n\\nAnalytics & Reporting\\n\\nInsights shows you realtime analytics of your Linear data so you can spot trends and remove blockers.\\n\\nLook at Insights for specific teams or create a workspace-wide view to look at your Asks data across your workspace. Consider using the following parameters to filter your views, as well as to measure, slice, and segment your data.\\n\\nExternal source: Apply this filter on a view and then select Asks to see only issues filed through Asks.  \\n\\nTeams: Slice by team to better understand the differences between how different Linear teams process Asks.\\n\\nTemplates: Slice by template to see how your different Asks templates are used across a team or workspace.\\n\\nSLAs and Lead time: Explore how quickly Asks are resolved and whether your team is meeting SLAs.\\n\\nTriage time: See how quickly Asks are reviewed and assigned to a team member.\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\n\"},{\"id\":\"5d0a0985-9774-419f-8aa2-4cc07b4926ab\",\"title\":\"Private teams\",\"url\":\"https://linear.app/docs/private-teams\",\"snippet\":\"Create private teams for issues that should only be accessed by certain workspace members.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nThis feature is available on Linear's Business and Enterprise plans. Anyone in the workspace can create a private team or make an existing team private.\\n\\nPrivate teams may be helpful in cases where:\\n\\nWork is sensitive and should be limited to only some team members (e.g. HR, customer data, founders or exec team).\\n\\nYou want a personal team to keep track of issues.\\n\\nVisibility\\n\\nPrivate team: Workspace admins can see all private teams in settings under Settings > Administration > Teams, update team settings, or join a private team by adding themselves as a member.

It's possible to access private issue data with the API if you are using a personal API key of a user that has access to private teams. Webhooks can also expose data from private teams as webhooks for private teams can be set up by team owners and workspace admins.\\n\\nIntegrations\\n\\nSome existing integrations have limitations to account for private data, while others will have more complete access to all workspace contents.\"}]"}]}
