Priority is rapid development and core functionality.\n\n## Core Features\n\n### 1. Video Playback\n- Basic play/pause functionality\n- Support for MP4/MOV formats (expand as needed)\n- Frame-precise navigation\n- Current time display with frame number\n- UI: Simple. Only video + progress bar + markers. All other UI should be implemented through toggleable modals\n\n### 2. Custom Scrubbing System\n**Critical Feature** - Configurable scrubbing with:\n- **Configuration**:\n  - Backward key (customizable)\n  - Forward key (customizable)\n  - Seconds to skip when playing\n  - Frames to skip when paused\n- **Behavior**:\n  - When playing: Skip by N seconds\n  - When paused: Skip by N frames (frame-precise)\n- **Default Config Example**:\n  - Left/Right arrow keys\n  - 5 seconds when playing\n  - 1 frame when paused\n\n### 3. Progress Bar\n- Thick rectangular bar spanning window width\n- Visual markers displayed on bar\n- Click to seek\n- Segment visualization (shaded regions between markers)\n\n### 4. Marker System\n- **Creation**:\n  - Keyboard shortcut to add marker at current position\n  - Automatic start marker at 00:00\n  - Maximum ~50-60 markers per video\n- **Properties**:\n  - Timestamp (frame-precise)\n  - Rating (1-5 stars)\n  - Labels field (for future use)\n  - Unique ID\n- **Editing**:\n  - Edit markers after creation\n  - Adjust timestamp\n  - Change rating\n  - Update labels\n\n### 5. Segment System\n- **Automatic Creation**:\n  - Segments = regions between consecutive markers\n  - Start segment: 00:00 to first marker\n  - End segment: last marker to video end\n- **Future Use**:\n  - Extract individual segments\n  - Extract multiple segments based on rating threshold\n  - Frame-precise extraction\n\n### 6. Modal System Architecture\n- **Base Modal Class**:\n  - Reusable modal foundation\n  - Standard appearance/behavior\n- **Implementations**:\n  - Marker Details Modal (edit marker properties)\n  - Shortcuts Settings Modal (configure all shortcuts)\n  - Future modals as needed\n\n### 7. Keyboard Shortcuts System\n**Critical** - Comprehensive shortcut system:\n- All major actions via keyboard\n- Configurable shortcuts\n- Shortcuts settings modal\n- Persistent shortcut preferences\n- Examples:\n  - Add marker\n  - Delete marker\n  - Navigate between markers\n  - Open marker details\n  - Custom scrub keys\n\n### 8. Data Management\n- Save/load project files\n- Store:\n  - Video file reference\n  - All markers with timestamps, ratings, labels\n  - Shortcut configurations\n  - Scrub settings\n- Simple JSON format for easy parsing\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n### Platform\n- macOS native application\n- Swift + SwiftUI or AppKit\n- AVFoundation for video playback\n\n### Performance\n- Frame-accurate seeking when paused\n- Smooth, fast seeking when playing\n- Smooth playback\n- Responsive UI during scrubbing\n\n### Frame Precision\n- Display current frame number when paused\n- Frame-level marker placement\n- Frame-accurate segment boundaries\n- Frame-precise extraction support\n\n## Development Priorities\n\n### Phase 1 - Core Functionality\n1. Basic video player with play/pause\n2. Custom scrubbing system\n3. Progress bar with seeking\n4. Marker creation/display\n5. Basic import/export of markers from json files\n6. Hardware accelerated playback\n\n### Phase 2 - Editing & Configuration  \n1. Modal system architecture\n2. Marker details modal\n3. Shortcuts configuration modal\n4. Marker editing functionality\n\n### Phase 3 - Extraction (Future)\n1. Segment extraction\n2. Rating-based filtering\n3. Batch extraction\n\n## Simplified Decisions (Speed of Development)\n- Basic file picker (no drag-drop initially)\n- Start with MP4 only\n- Simple JSON storage\n\n## Key Success Criteria\n1. Frame-precise navigation and marking\n2. Configurable scrubbing that feels responsive\n3. Quick marker creation workflow\n4. Reliable save/load of all data\n5. Extensible modal system for future features\n\n## Future Extraction Feature (Placeholder)\n- Extract individual segments to new video files\n- Extract multiple segments matching criteria:\n  - Rating >= threshold\n  - Specific labels\n  - Time ranges\n- Combine multiple segments into single output\n- Frame-accurate extraction boundaries\n","numLines":153,"startLine":1,"totalLines":153}}}
