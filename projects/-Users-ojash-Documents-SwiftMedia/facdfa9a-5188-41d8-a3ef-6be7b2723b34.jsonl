And then in the first phase we should just implement single segment extraction where when I open the extraction modal it opens to a tab for segment extraction each of the different types of extractions should have a separate tab in the modal. It opens to there and then I can extract the segment that the current time is in. I want to use FFmpeg for the extraction and how I want it to work at least for now is I want to do like a stream copy where we just copy the function for extraction takes in like the start time of start time frame and then the end time frame which is one frame before the marker marking the end of the segment and it should just stream copy that into a mp4 file. Right, so no encoding for now. Then I want to utilize this function to implement the other types of extraction types. And then after that finally I want to optimize the extraction so that we can do lossless extraction. And basically the way I see us doing that is when we extract we'll look for the two iframes that are closest to the start and end of the segment that are contained in the segment. We can stream copy that and then to the head and the tail that were not extracted from that stream copy we should extract and re-encode. And that will minimize the frame skip or lag issues that we have."},"uuid":"cc1e1bb8-008a-493c-9438-1cb9a1c8b377","timestamp":"2025-06-26T02:14:35.727Z"}
