It's free and open-sourced under the GPLv3 license.\n\n## Plugin System and API\n\nThe plugin system allows you to extend IINA's functionality with JavaScript. You can control the playback, call the mpv API, access the network and file system, adding custom UI elements, and more. The plugin system is available in IINA 1.4.0.\n\nKey capabilities include:\n- Access the mpv API with properties and hooks for advanced playback control\n- Spawn and control multiple player instances\n- Render custom webview-based content on the top of videos, add a tab in the sidebar with custom webview-based contents, or display a webview-based standalone window\n- Everything the player does is accessible via a concise API\n\n## Development Setup\n\nFor building IINA from source:\n- Open iina.xcodeproj in the latest public version of Xcode. IINA may not build if you use any other version\n- The build process generates MPVOption.swift, MPVCommand.swift and MPVProperty.swift files\n- IINA uses CocoaPods for managing the installation of third-party libraries\n\n## Plugin Development Tools\n\nAn iina-plugin command line tool is included with the IINA installation to help you create, build, and run plugins. Complete documentation with tutorials and API references is available.\n\nTypeScript definitions for the plugin API are available.\n\n## Important Notes\n\nWhile IINA provides a JavaScript-based plugin API for extending functionality, there doesn't appear to be a native Swift SDK or framework specifically designed for embedding IINA as a component within other macOS applications. The plugin system is the primary way to extend IINA's capabilities, but it operates through JavaScript rather than native Swift integration.\n\nFor developers looking to integrate video playback in Swift applications, you might need to consider:\n1.
