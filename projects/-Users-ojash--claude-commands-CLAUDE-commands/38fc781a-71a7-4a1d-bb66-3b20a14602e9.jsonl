If there's a lot of updated files, I want to group them. And ideally for grouping, each group should be kind of each set of files that are grouped together in a commit should kind of be as atomic as possible. Not as possible, but to a reasonable level.

Group related files into logical commits:\n   - Files in the same directory/module\n   - Files with similar functionality (e.g., component + its tests)\n   - Config files with their related code changes\n   - Keep groups reasonably sized (3-8 files per commit typically)\n   - Avoid mixing unrelated changes (e.g., feature code with unrelated refactoring)\n\n3. For each group:\n   - Stage the files: `git add <files>`\n   - Generate a descriptive commit message based on:\n     * The type of change (feat/fix/refactor/test/docs/chore)\n     * The scope/area affected\n     * A brief description of what changed\n   - Create the commit\n\n4.
