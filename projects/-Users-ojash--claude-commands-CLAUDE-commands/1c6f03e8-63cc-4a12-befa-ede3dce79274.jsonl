Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to various data sources and tools.\n\n## Key Integration Features\n\n### 1. **Standardized Connection Protocol**\nIt provides a universal, open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources, replacing fragmented integrations with a single protocol. The result is a simpler, more reliable way to give AI systems access to the data they need.\n\n### 2. **Dynamic Tool Discovery**\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) enables makers to connect to existing knowledge servers and APIs directly from Copilot Studio. When connecting to an MCP server, actions and knowledge are automatically added to the agent and updated as functionality evolves.\n\n### 3. **Two-Way Communication**\nMCP supports persistent, real-time two-way communication - similar to WebSockets. The AI model can both retrieve information and trigger actions dynamically.\n\n### 4. **Automatic Updates**\nEach tool published by the MCP server is automatically added as an action in Copilot Studio and inherits the name, description, inputs, and outputs. As tools are updated or removed on the MCP server, Copilot Studio automatically reflects these changes, ensuring users always have the latest versions and that obsolete tools are removed.\n\n## Linear Integration Specifics\n\nWe've created pre-built MCP servers for services like Linear, Slack, GitHub, and Google Workspace, so you can focus on building AI experiences rather than integration details. For users, it means connecting AI models to your Figma file and Linear tickets without needing a CS degree.\n\n## API Architecture\n\n### Client-Server Model\nThe Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.\n\n### Authentication Support\nComposio MCP solves the core challenges of authentication and ecosystem maturity. Our managed servers provide built-in authentication support for over 100 applications, automatically handling OAuth, API keys, and basic auth flows.\n\n### Security Features\nMCP brings in some much-needed security by standardizing authorization using an OAuth 2.0 flow. This allows for fine-grained permission scoping (read-only, write-only) on all MCP capabilities.\n\n## Developer Benefits\n\n1. **Simplified Development**: Write once, integrate multiple times without rewriting custom code for every integration\n\n2. **Flexibility**: MCP servers can dynamically provide tools and data to agents. This enables greater flexibility while reducing maintenance and integration costs\n\n3. **SDK Support**: This offering additionally includes Software Development Kit (SDK) support, enabling further customization and flexibility for your integrations\n\n4. **Real-time Context**: MCP connections remain active, enabling real-time context updates and interactions\n\n## Current Adoption\n\nEarly adopters like Block and Apollo have integrated MCP into their systems, while development tools companies including Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph are working with MCP to enhance their platforms. Fast-forward to March 2025, and suddenly, MCP has become the hottest topic in the AI space.\n\nThe Model Context Protocol represents a significant advancement in AI integration, particularly for services like Linear, by providing a standardized, secure, and maintainable way to connect AI models with project management tools and other external systems."}]},"uuid":"cbf08513-6ded-4947-ae2f-03934eb68746","timestamp":"2025-06-25T20:19:23.363Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Linear MCP Model Context Protocol integration features API","results":["I'll search for information about Linear MCP Model Context Protocol integration features and API.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01S74VoBfVLP4tJeES9QDU14","content":[{"title":"Introduction - Model Context Protocol","url":"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction"},{"title":"Model Context Protocol (MCP): A Guide With Demo Project | DataCamp","url":"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/mcp-model-context-protocol"},{"title":"Introducing the Model Context Protocol \\ Anthropic","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol"},{"title":"Model Context Protocol · GitHub","url":"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol"},{"title":"Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP) in Copilot Studio: Simplified Integration with AI Apps and Agents | Microsoft Copilot Blog","url":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/introducing-model-context-protocol-mcp-in-copilot-studio-simplified-integration-with-ai-apps-and-agents/"},{"title":"What Is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and How It Works","url":"https://www.descope.com/learn/post/mcp"},{"title":"What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?","url":"https://www.builder.io/blog/model-context-protocol"},{"title":"What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Linear is a project management system, and this MCP server provides integration between AI models and Linear's API.\n\n## Multiple Linear MCP Server Implementations\n\nThere are several implementations of Linear MCP servers available:\n\n1. **Standard Linear MCP Server** - Allows LLM to interact with Linear's API for project management, including searching, creating, and updating issues\n\n2. **Linear (Go) Implementation** - Allows LLM to interact with Linear's API via a single static binary\n\n3. **Linear MCP (Full Implementation)** - Full blown implementation of the Linear SDK to support comprehensive Linear management of projects, initiatives, issues, users, teams and states\n\n4. **jerhadf/linear-mcp-server** - A specific implementation on GitHub, though this MCP Server is now deprecated and is no longer being maintained. The developer recommends using the official Linear remote MCP server.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nThe Linear MCP server typically provides the following capabilities:\n\n- Integration with Linear's issue tracking system through MCP, allowing LLMs to interact with Linear issues\n- Search functionality for finding specific issues\n- Creating new issues and projects\n- Updating existing issues\n- Managing comments on issues\n- Comprehensive Linear management of projects, initiatives, issues, users, teams and states\n\n## GitHub Projects and Repositories\n\nThe Linear MCP server is part of the broader Model Context Protocol ecosystem. Key repositories include:\n\n1. **modelcontextprotocol/servers** - The main repository for Model Context Protocol Servers\n2. **docker/mcp-servers** - Another collection of MCP servers\n3. **jerhadf/linear-mcp-server** - A specific Linear MCP implementation (now deprecated)\n\n## Known Issues and Status\n\n1. **Deprecation of Some Implementations** - The jerhadf/linear-mcp-server implementation is now deprecated and is no longer being maintained\n\n2. **Official Recommendation** - Users are directed to use the official Linear remote MCP server instead of deprecated implementations\n\n## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Context\n\nThe Model Context Protocol is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments. It provides a universal, open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources, replacing fragmented integrations with a single protocol.\n\nThe MCP ecosystem includes:\n- An open source project run by Anthropic, PBC. and open to contributions from the entire community\n- Official SDKs in multiple languages (Python, TypeScript, C#, Ruby)\n- Official integrations maintained by companies building production ready MCP servers for their platforms\n\n## Installation and Usage\n\nFor the Linear MCP server, typical installation involves:\n- Using npx for TypeScript-based implementations\n- Configuring with a Linear API key\n- Setting up in MCP clients like Claude Desktop or VS Code\n\nThe Linear MCP server allows AI assistants to effectively manage project workflows, track issues, and collaborate on Linear-based projects through natural language interactions."}]},"uuid":"5e1f738c-aa94-4646-ad49-aa77b19f2c58","timestamp":"2025-06-25T20:20:03.314Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"Linear MCP server\" capabilities issues projects github modelcontextprotocol","results":["I'll search for information about Linear MCP server, its capabilities, issues, projects on GitHub, and its relation to the Model Context Protocol.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01UP5uEfPt8kiYNF3Z2jhJBn","content":[{"title":"GitHub - modelcontextprotocol/servers: Model Context Protocol Servers","url":"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers"},{"title":"GitHub - docker/mcp-servers: Model Context Protocol Servers","url":"https://github.com/docker/mcp-servers"},{"title":"GitHub - wong2/awesome-mcp-servers: A curated list of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers","url":"https://github.com/wong2/awesome-mcp-servers"},{"title":"GitHub - modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk: The official Python SDK for Model Context Protocol servers and clients","url":"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk"},{"title":"Model Context Protocol · GitHub","url":"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol"},{"title":"Example Servers - Model Context Protocol","url":"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples"},{"title":"Use MCP servers in VS Code (Preview)","url":"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers"},{"title":"GitHub - jerhadf/linear-mcp-server: A server that integrates Linear's project management system with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to allow LLMs to interact with Linear.","url":"https://github.com/jerhadf/linear-mcp-server"},{"title":"GitHub - appcypher/awesome-mcp-servers: Awesome MCP Servers - A curated list of Model Context Protocol servers","url":"https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-mcp-servers"},{"title":"Introducing the Model Context Protocol \\ Anthropic","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol"}]},"Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the Linear MCP server, its capabilities, issues, and related projects on GitHub within the Model Context Protocol ecosystem.\n\n## Linear MCP Server Overview\n\nThe Linear MCP server is a Model Context Protocol implementation that enables AI assistants to search, create, and update Linear issues, projects, and comments.

If the \"Triage\" feature is turned on for the team, then the issue will be assigned to the Triage workflow state.\n\n## API Features\n\n### Authentication\n- The Linear API supports personal API keys and OAuth2 authentication. If you're building an application for others to use, we recommend you use OAuth2 authentication.\n- For each key you create, you can choose to give it full access to the data your user can access, or restrict it to certain permissions (Read, Write, Admin, Create issues, Create comments).\n\n### SDK and Tools\n- Linear provides a SDK that exposes the Linear GraphQL schema and makes it easy to access models and perform mutations.\n- Our GraphQL API is explorable and queryable via Apollo Studio, no download or log in required. Click the Schema tab to browse the schema, and click the Explorer tab to run queries.\n\n### Real-time Updates\n- Register a programmatic webhook and get updates for all issues for the team. When you detect changes, update the issue information. You can also automatically register webhooks for OAuth applications.\n\nThe Linear GraphQL API provides comprehensive access to teams, cycles, labels, and workflows, allowing developers to build powerful integrations and automations around Linear's project management features."}]},"uuid":"32fa244d-fd3e-4330-a5c5-ab151e73149c","timestamp":"2025-06-25T20:20:53.526Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Linear API GraphQL capabilities teams cycles labels workflows","results":["I'll search for information about Linear's API GraphQL capabilities, specifically focusing on teams, cycles, labels, and workflows.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01NbYUKqHv3nFLrTrn1baaSw","content":[{"title":"Working with the GraphQL API","url":"https://developers.linear.app/docs/graphql/working-with-the-graphql-api"},{"title":"Linear API's Graph | GraphOS Studio","url":"https://studio.apollographql.com/public/Linear-API/schema/reference?variant=current"},{"title":"API and Webhooks – Linear Docs","url":"https://linear.app/docs/api-and-webhooks"},{"title":"Linear API Essentials","url":"https://rollout.com/integration-guides/linear/api-essentials"},{"title":"Linear Developers","url":"https://linear.app/developers"},{"title":"Getting started – Linear Developers","url":"https://linear.app/developers/graphql"},{"title":"linear/packages/sdk/src/schema.graphql at master · linear/linear","url":"https://github.com/linear/linear/blob/master/packages/sdk/src/schema.graphql"},{"title":"Linear API's Graph | GraphOS Studio - Apollo GraphQL","url":"https://studio.apollographql.com/public/Linear-API/schema/reference/scalars/Boolean?variant=current"},{"title":"Changelog – Linear","url":"https://linear.app/changelog"},{"title":"Linear – Plan and build products","url":"https://linear.app"}]},"Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Linear's API GraphQL capabilities for teams, cycles, labels, and workflows:\n\n## Linear API GraphQL Overview\n\nLinear's public API is built using GraphQL.

What I'm thinking is when we start working on an initiative, we kind of at the very least create steps for all of the project files and the issue files. And then maybe we fill out high level what we need to do for each of these in the markdown files. And we create a graph as well. Like a dependency graph. And then. And then as we move on and we answer them when I go to work on a project, we maybe add some more things to the projects project. And then we can use the graph to identify if there's other things that we need to update other partially filled out stubs, etc. And then kind of the same thing when we actually go to implement a specific plan. And then the idea would be when we're actually implementing a plan or planning out a plan. What we have access to is we have access to that plan. All other things linked to that point. And then everything up, which is like, I don't know, one neighbor in the graph. Two neighbors and like two jumps in the graph away or is like a direct parent.

Using **both** JSON (as source of truth) and Mermaid (for visualization) is the best approach. Here's my thinking:\n\n## **Dual Graph System**\n\n### **JSON as Source of Truth**\n```json\n{\n  \"nodes\": {\n    \"uuid-init-1\": {\n      \"type\": \"initiative\",\n      \"linearId\": \"LIN-INIT-123\",\n      \"title\": \"E-commerce Platform\",\n      \"status\": \"in_progress\",\n      \"created\": \"2024-01-15\",\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"priority\": \"high\",\n        \"owner\": \"team-1\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"uuid-proj-1\": {\n      \"type\": \"project\",\n      \"linearId\": \"LIN-PROJ-456\",\n      \"title\": \"User Authentication\",\n      \"parent\": \"uuid-init-1\",\n      \"phase\": \"design\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"edges\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"edge-1\",\n      \"from\": \"uuid-init-1\",\n      \"to\": \"uuid-proj-1\",\n      \"type\": \"contains\",\n      \"metadata\": {}\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"edge-2\", \n      \"from\": \"uuid-proj-1\",\n      \"to\": \"uuid-proj-2\",\n      \"type\": \"blocks\",\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"reason\": \"Auth required for payments\",\n        \"created\": \"2024-01-16\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### **Generated Mermaid Visualization**\n```markdown\n## Dependency Graph\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph \"E-commerce Platform\"\n        P1[User Authentication<br/>🟡 Design Phase]\n        P2[Payment System<br/>🔴 Blocked]\n        P3[Product Catalog<br/>🟢 Active]\n    end\n    \n    P1 -->|blocks| P2\n    P1 -->|enables| P3\n    \n    subgraph \"User Auth Issues\"\n        I1[Login Implementation]\n        I2[Registration]\n    end\n    \n    P1 --> I1\n    P1 --> I2\n    I1 -->|shares code| I2\n```\n\nStatus: Generated from graph.json on 2024-01-20\n```\n\n### **Python Script Structure**\n```python\n# .claude/linear/scripts/graph_visualizer.py\n\ndef json_to_mermaid(graph_json_path, output_md_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert JSON graph to Mermaid diagram\n    - Groups by initiative\n    - Shows status with emoji\n    - Simplifies labels for readability\n    - Handles different edge types\n    \"\"\"\n    \ndef update_all_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Regenerate all Mermaid diagrams from JSON sources\n    Called after any graph update\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef validate_graph(graph_json):\n    \"\"\"\n    Ensure graph integrity:\n    - No orphaned nodes\n    - No circular dependencies at same level\n    - All UUIDs exist in Linear\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### **Alternative Approaches to Consider:**\n\n1. **GraphViz DOT format** (instead of Mermaid)\n   - Pro: More powerful layouts\n   - Con: Requires external tools\n\n2. **D2 Diagrams**\n   - Pro: Better for complex diagrams\n   - Con: Less widespread support\n\n3. **Interactive HTML**\n   - Generate D3.js or Cytoscape.js visualizations\n   - Pro: Interactive exploration\n   - Con: Can't embed in Markdown\n\n### **Keeping Them in Sync:**\n\n```bash\n# Commands that auto-sync\n@linear-update-graph.md      # Updates JSON, regenerates Mermaid\n@linear-validate-graph.md    # Checks consistency\n@linear-graph-report.md      # Shows both JSON stats and visual\n\n# File structure\n.claude/linear/\n├── graphs/\n│   ├── {initiative-id}/\n│   │   ├── graph.json       # Source of truth\n│   │   ├── graph.md         # Generated visual\n│   │   └── graph.html       # Optional interactive\n│   └── master-graph.json    # Cross-initiative dependencies\n```\n\n### **Benefits of This Approach:**\n\n1. **JSON for Operations:**\n   - Easy to query (\"find all blocked issues\")\n   - Simple to update programmatically\n   - Can store rich metadata\n\n2. **Mermaid for Understanding:**\n   - Quick visual verification\n   - Easy to share in documentation\n   - Can customize for different views\n\n3. **Python Script Features:**\n   - Multiple view types (by status, by team, by timeline)\n   - Filtering (show only critical path)\n   - Validation (detect issues)\n   - Auto-layout optimization\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.

Each level (initiative → project → issue) inherits context from its parent.\n\n### 2. **Dependency Graph**\nA dual-system with JSON for data and Mermaid for visualization. The graph tracks relationships and enables smart context loading.\n\n### 3. **Progressive Elaboration**\nStart with high-level plans and add detail as you progress. Knowledge propagates both up and down the hierarchy.\n\n## Command Overview\n\n### Planning & Creation\n- `init-initiative.md` - Create full initiative structure with stubs\n- `init-project.md` - Add project to existing initiative\n- `elaborate-plan.md` - Progressively add detail to any plan\n\n### Analysis\n- `analyze-initiative.md` - High-level initiative planning\n- `analyze-project.md` - Detailed project breakdown\n- `analyze-issue.md` - Implementation planning\n\n### Working & Context\n- `work-context.md` - Load smart context (2 graph hops)\n- `daily-check.md` - Daily planning assistant\n- `impact-analysis.md` - Analyze change impacts\n\n### Maintenance\n- `update-graph.md` - Manage dependency relationships\n- `sync-plans.md` - Synchronize plans across hierarchy\n- `show-graph.md` - Visualize dependencies\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. **Start Initiative**\n   ```bash\n   @linear/init-initiative\n   ```\n   Creates full structure with project and issue stubs.\n\n2. **Analyze & Plan**\n   ```bash\n   @linear/analyze-initiative\n   @linear/analyze-project\n   ```\n   Progressively detail your plans.\n\n3. **Daily Work**\n   ```bash\n   @linear/daily-check\n   @linear/work-context\n   ```\n   Get focused context and priorities.\n\n4. **Track Progress**\n   ```bash\n   @linear/show-graph\n   @linear/impact-analysis\n   ```\n   Visualize dependencies and impacts.\n\n## Data Structure\n\n```\n.claude/linear/\n├── initiatives/\n│   └── {id}/\n│       ├── plan.md\n│       ├── graph.json\n│       └── projects/\n├── context/\n│   └── current.json\n└── graphs/\n    └── visualizations/\n```\n\n## Graph Visualization\n\nUse the Python script to generate Mermaid diagrams:\n```bash\npython scripts/graph_visualizer.py graph.json --view full\n```\n\nView options: full, critical, status\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Start with Stubs** - Don't over-plan initially\n2. **Elaborate as Needed** - Add detail when you need it\n3. **Update the Graph** - Keep dependencies current\n4. **Sync Regularly** - Propagate learnings\n5. **Check Daily** - Use daily-check for focus\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Linear MCP server configured\n- Python 3.x for graph visualization\n- Access to Linear workspace"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":390,"cache_read_input_tokens":38946,"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CQVd2hD6dp63DfqnLi17p","type":"assistant","uuid":"3672b1f8-18a1-4828-be9a-660088ab3044","timestamp":"2025-06-25T21:07:59.780Z"}
