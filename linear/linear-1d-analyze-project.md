Analyze a Linear project and create detailed implementation plan.

## Process:
1. Fetch project details from Linear MCP
2. Load parent initiative context for constraints
3. Analyze project scope:
   - Technical requirements
   - Architecture decisions needed
   - Integration points
   - Performance requirements
   - Security considerations
4. Break down into issues:
   - Core functionality tasks
   - Infrastructure setup
   - Testing requirements
   - Documentation needs
   - Edge cases and error handling
5. Identify dependencies:
   - Within project (task order)
   - External (other projects)
   - Technical (libraries, APIs)
   - Resource (team availability)
6. Create detailed plan:
   - Implementation phases
   - Critical path items
   - Risk mitigation
   - Testing strategy

## Interactive Discussion:
- Clarify technical approach
- Validate assumptions
- Discuss trade-offs
- Identify potential blockers
- Confirm implementation order

## Output:
- Detailed project plan with phases
- Issue breakdown with estimates
- Updated dependency graph
- Technical decision record
- Next steps for issue analysis
