Create a new Linear project within an existing initiative.

## Process:
1. Verify parent initiative exists
2. Use Linear MCP to create the project
3. Set project properties:
   - Name and description
   - Parent initiative link
   - Lead/owner assignment
   - Initial status
   - Target dates
4. Break down into issues:
   - Core feature tasks
   - Setup and infrastructure
   - Testing tasks
   - Documentation
   - Review and deployment
5. Create issue stubs in Linear
6. Update dependency graph:
   - Add project node
   - Add issue nodes
   - Link to initiative
   - Add inter-project dependencies
7. Create planning structure:
   - Project plan with phases
   - Issue stubs for elaboration
   - Update initiative plan

## Interactive Process:
- Describe project goals
- Identify major components
- Define success criteria
- Estimate complexity
- Set initial timeline

## Output:
- Project created in Linear
- Issues created and linked
- Graph updated with new nodes
- Plan stubs ready for elaboration
- Ready for @linear/analyze-project.md
