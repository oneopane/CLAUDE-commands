Create a new Linear initiative with full project and issue stub structure.

## Steps:
1. Use Linear MCP to create the initiative
2. Ask for project breakdown (or analyze description for suggestions)
3. For each project:
   - Create project in Linear
   - Ask for/suggest issue breakdown
   - Create issue stubs
4. Generate dependency graph structure:
   - Create graph.json with all entities
   - Identify and map dependencies
   - Generate initial Mermaid visualization
5. Create living document structure:
   - Initiative plan with goals and constraints
   - Project plan stubs with phases
   - Issue plan stubs with basic info
6. Set up tracking:
   - Store Linear IDs and UUIDs
   - Create context/current.json
   - Update index.md

## Interactive Process:
- Describe the initiative's goals and success criteria
- List major projects/features needed
- For each project, identify key issues/tasks
- Define dependencies between projects
- Set priority and timeline estimates

## Output:
- Full Linear hierarchy created
- Living document stubs ready for elaboration
- Dependency graph for navigation
- Ready to start work with @linear/work-context.md
