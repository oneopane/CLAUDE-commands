Analyze a Linear initiative and create comprehensive planning structure.

## Process:
1. Fetch initiative details from Linear MCP
2. Analyze scope and objectives:
   - Business goals and success criteria
   - Technical requirements and constraints
   - Timeline and resource considerations
   - Risk factors and dependencies
3. Break down into projects:
   - Identify major feature areas
   - Define project boundaries
   - Establish project priorities
   - Map inter-project dependencies
4. High-level planning for each project:
   - Key deliverables
   - Rough effort estimates
   - Critical path items
   - Technical approach
5. Create planning structure:
   - Initiative plan with roadmap
   - Project stubs with phases
   - Initial dependency graph
   - Risk registry

## Interactive Discussion:
- Clarify ambiguous requirements
- Validate assumptions
- Discuss architectural decisions
- Identify potential blockers
- Confirm priority order

## Output:
- Comprehensive initiative plan
- Project breakdown with estimates
- Dependency graph visualization
- Next steps for project analysis
